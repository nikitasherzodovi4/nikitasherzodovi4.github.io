		<p style="text-indent: 1.5em">As a backpack traveler, I had a chance to try many cheap but authentic street dishes. Visiting street food place in the city where you travel is not only a great way to fulfill your need of calories, but find out many traditions behind it. In most of cases, people cook it the same way as they used to hundreds of years ago, so besides showing the culture of the country, street food can explain a little bit about the history as well. However, it is not that easy to find a proper street food place in places that are popular among tourists. Here are couple of hints of how to make it right.
		</p>
		<p>
		1.It is better to taste street food away from the main tourist attraction places. You wonâ€™t need to stay in the line and probably will be able to save some money as well.
		</p>
		<p>2. Follow the locals! Local people always know where the best street food is.
